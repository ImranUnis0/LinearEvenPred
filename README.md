# LinearEvenPred
A linear regression model designed specifically to predict outcomes for even numbers with precision and simplicity
EvenSense: Simple Linear Regression Example for Beginners
Overview
This project is a basic example of linear regression, specially created for beginners who are learning machine learning concepts. It demonstrates how to use linear regression with a simple, self-created dataset of even numbers, making it ideal for understanding fundamental concepts without getting overwhelmed by complex datasets.

Purpose
This program is intended for students or new learners who want to see a basic linear regression model in action. It’s a simple, illustrative project, using only a small dataset created specifically for this example. The goal is to help beginners understand:

How linear regression works.
The process of training and predicting with minimal data.
Dataset
This project uses a manually created dataset of 10 even numbers. This limited dataset helps keep the focus on understanding the model rather than data complexities. It’s an ideal example for those just starting out in data science and machine learning.
Usage
Load the Example Data: The program comes with a small dataset of even numbers for input and output.
Run the Program: Follow the instructions to train the model and make predictions based on these even numbers.
Limitations
This example is only intended for educational purposes and may not perform well with other datasets. It has not been tested on larger, external datasets, so predictions might not generalize beyond this specific example.

Contributions
Contributions are welcome to help make this a more comprehensive learning tool for beginners!
Example code:
1 Importing the model
from model import EvenSensePredictor

2 Initializing the predictor
predictor = EvenSensePredictor()

3 Training the model (with the pre-created simple dataset)
predictor.train()

4 Making a prediction
prediction = predictor.predict(12)  # Enter an even number to predict
print("Prediction for 12:", prediction)
